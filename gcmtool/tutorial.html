<h1>gcmtool</h1>
<p>gcmtool is the main program in the project. It's used for working 
directly with .gcm files. To see its full-usage, call it with the -? argument:

<code>$ <b>gcmtool -?</b>          
GCMTool 0.2.4- A utility for working with Nintendo GameCube DVD 
images.
        gcmtool.sourceforge.net

Usage:  gcmtool [ options ] <filename>

Use -? for extended usage.

    Options:
      -e &lt;source&gt; &lt;dest_dir&gt;
        Extracts the file from &lt;source&gt; (in the GCM) to 
&lt;dest_dir&gt; (local filesystem)<center>
.
.
.
.
.
.</center></code>

<p>Its most basic use, it takes one argument; a gcm:</p>

<code>$ <b>gcmtool d3-thug.iso</b> 
Filename:       d3-thug.iso
System ID:      G (Gamecube)
Game ID:        TD
Region:         E (USA/NTSC)
Maker Code:     52 (Activision)
Game Name:      Tony Hawk's Underground
DOL offset:     125760
Apploader:      9280
ApploaderSize:  6452
FST:            3159456
File count:     2165</code>

<p>The first handful of fields are self explanitory. The rest are just 
for general info if you're gonna do some more low-level hacking.</p>

<h2>Basic Usage</h2>

<h3>Verbose Output</h3>

<p>The -v (or --verbose) option is used to enable verbosity. Useful for 
figuring out 
what's going wrong or why it seems like gcmtool isn't working right (ie- 
shows each file as it's being added or extracted).</p>

<h3>Listing The Filesystem</h3>

<p>the -l option (or --list) will list the filesystem of hte GCM. You 
can 
include extra options (such as +i (or --full-info) or +p (or 
--full-paths) to get even more information about the files). An 
example:</p>

<code>$ <b>gcmtool --list --full-info d3-thug.iso </b>
Filename:       d3-thug.iso
System ID:      G (Gamecube)
Game ID:        TD
Region:         E (USA/NTSC)
Maker Code:     52 (Activision)
Game Name:      Tony Hawk's Underground
DOL offset:     125760
Apploader:      9280
ApploaderSize:  6452
FST:            3159456
File count:     2165
(2164)         /
(0)             anims/
(25)            customparks/
19145            custom1.prk
15000            custom10.prk
15000            custom11.prk
15000            custom12.prk
15000            custom13.prk
15000            custom14.prk
15000            custom15.prk
15000            custom16.prk
15000            custom17.prk
15000            custom18.prk
15000            custom19.prk
<center>.

<p>The numbers that precede each file are the sizes, in bytes, for 
files, or the number of children for directories.</p>

<h2>Extraction</h2>

<h3>Files</h3>

<p>Now that you can view the filesystem of a GCM, you're ready to 
extract. 
You can extract the entire filesystem by typing:</p>

<code>$ <b>gcmtool -e / . some_game.gcm</b></code>

<p>That will create a directory called "some_game.gcm.FILES" and put the 
filesystem in there. You can also specify a file or directory in the GCM 
to extract and where to put it.</p>

<h3>Sections</h3>

<p>There are several commands for extracting various portions of a GCM, 
for either backup purposes or to encapsulate your work on them:</p>

<code>-edh, --extract-disk-header [ +f &lt;filename&gt; ]
        Extract the disk header (boot.bin)

-edhi, --extract-disk-header-info [ +f &lt;filename&gt; ]
        Extract the disk header info (bi2.bin)

-eal, --extract-apploader [ +f &lt;filename&gt; ]
        Extract the apploader (appldr.bin)

-ed, --extract-boot-dol [ +f &lt;filename&gt; ]
        Extract the main executable DOL (boot.dol)</code>
<p>These commands take an optional +f &lt;filename&gt; parameter where 
you can specify a location to save them. If the parameter is omitted, it 
uses a default filename in your current, working directory.</p>

<p>See the <a 
href="http://www.gc-linux.org/docs/yagcd/chap13.html#sec13.4">documentation</a> 
at gc-linux.org for detailed explanations of said sections.</p>

<p>You may think "Oh man, I can extract a game's DOL?!?! sweet!" but in 
actuality, it's not very useful. The DOL itself calls on files in the 
GCM's filesystem, so you can't just use PSUL to load the DOL and play 
your game. In fact, the game may even seem to start, but hang with a 
black screen.</p>

<h2>Injection</h2>

<h3>Files</h3>

<p>You can't inject a single file due to the sheer amount of data 
shifting that needs to be done, and there's really no reason to just put 
one in. Also, it's not like you don't have 2 minutes to spare whilst the 
thing rebuilds the entire filesystem, so suck it up.<p>

<p>To rebuild the filesystem use the -rfs &lt;path&gt; argument:<p>

<code>GOTTA ADD THIS...</code>

<h3>Sections</h3>

<p>You can inject several sections of a GCM with the following 
commands.</p>

<code>-idh, --inject-disk-header [ +f <filename> ]
        Inject the disk header

-idhi, --inject-disk-header-info [ +f <filename> ]
        Inject the disk header info

-id, --inject-boot-dol [ +f <filename> ]
        Inject the main executable DOL</code>

<p>Currently, you can't inject the apploader due to limitations of the 
knowlege of GCM files (there's some data that comes after the apploader 
that may cause strange results if shifted).</p>

<p>Also, newly added to 0.2.4 is the ability to rebuild the filesystem 
of a GCM. It works by replacing the filesystem in its entirety.</p>

<code>$ <b>gcmtool -rfs some_files my_game.gcm</b></code>

<p>Good for when you need to modify a large quantity of files, delete 
files, or add files. Also very useful for reducing the size of a GCM, 
since it doesn't write all of the zeros that are usually used as padding 
in retail games. Future versions of gcmtool may support adding the 
padding.</p>
